# Plant Disease Prediction App

This project is aimed at developing a mobile application for predicting plant diseases using machine learning techniques. The app allows users to upload images of plant leaves and get predictions about whether the plant is healthy or diseased, along with information about the type of disease if detected.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of plant leaves from their device gallery.
- **Prediction**: The app uses a machine learning model to predict whether the uploaded plant leaf is healthy or diseased.
- **Disease Information**: If a disease is detected, the app provides information about the type of disease and possible remedies.
- **Registration**: Users can create accounts to access additional features and personalized recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Frontend development for the mobile app.
- **Flask**: Backend development for serving machine learning models and handling image uploads.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Machine learning framework used for training and deploying the disease prediction model.
- **Python**: Backend development and machine learning model training.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend design and styling for web pages.
- **Git**: Version control for managing project codebase.
